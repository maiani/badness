//! The `badness` command-line surface.
//!
//! Kept as a self-contained module (referencing only `std` and `clap`) so that
//! `build.rs` can `#[path = "src/cli.rs"]`-include it to generate man pages,
//! shell completions, and the markdown CLI reference, exactly as arity does.
//! Conversions to library types (e.g. [`WrapArg`] → `formatter::WrapMode`) live
//! in `main.rs`, never here, so the file compiles inside the build script too.
