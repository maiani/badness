# Command-line reference

A formatter, linter, and language server for LaTeX

**Usage:** `badness [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>`

## Options

`--config <PATH>`
:   Path to a `badness.toml` to use instead of discovering one. Applies to `format` and `lint`; ignored by `parse`, `lsp`, and `init`

`--no-config`
:   Ignore any `badness.toml` and use built-in defaults

## `badness format`

Format LaTeX source.

With paths, formats each file in place. With no paths, reads stdin and writes the formatted result to stdout.

**Usage:** `badness format [OPTIONS] [PATHS]...`

### Arguments

`<PATHS>...`
:   Files to format. Omit to read from stdin

### Options

`--check`
:   Report which files would change without writing them. Exits non-zero if any file is not already formatted

`--stdin-filepath <PATH>`
:   Name the stdin buffer so its language is dispatched by extension (`.bib` → BibTeX, anything else → LaTeX). No file is read or written; only the extension is used. Ignored when paths are given

`--line-width <LINE_WIDTH>`
:   Maximum line width before the formatter breaks a line

`--indent-width <INDENT_WIDTH>`
:   Number of spaces per indent step

`--wrap <WRAP>`
:   How to lay out line breaks inside a paragraph

    Possible values:

    - `reflow`: Greedy fill: wrap words to the line width (default)
    - `sentence`: One sentence per line (line width ignored)
    - `semantic`: Semantic line breaks (sembr.org): keep authored breaks and add breaks at sentence boundaries
    - `preserve`: Leave authored line breaks untouched

`--align-tables`
:   Column-align `tabular`/`array` and the math grids (`align`, matrix, …). On by default; pass `--no-align-tables` to leave hand-tuned column layout untouched. Overrides `[format] align-tables`

`--no-align-tables`
:   Disable column alignment of tables and math grids (see `--align-tables`)

`--format-options`
:   Reflow an authored-multi-line optional argument (`[key=val, …]`) one item per line. Off by default. Overrides `[format] format-options`

`--no-format-options`
:   Keep the width-driven layout of optional arguments (see `--format-options`)

`--exclude <PATTERN>`
:   Gitignore-style pattern to skip during directory discovery (repeatable). Added on top of any `exclude`/`extend-exclude` from `badness.toml`

`--force-exclude`
:   Apply exclude patterns to files named explicitly on the command line too (they are normally always processed). For runners like pre-commit that pass staged files as arguments

## `badness lint`

Lint LaTeX source, reporting parse diagnostics.

With paths, lints each file. With no paths, reads stdin. Exits non-zero if any diagnostics are reported.

**Usage:** `badness lint [OPTIONS] [PATHS]...`

### Arguments

`<PATHS>...`
:   Files to lint. Omit to read from stdin

### Options

`--fix`
:   Apply safe autofixes in place, then report what remains. Requires path arguments; has no effect on stdin (there is nothing to write)

`--unsafe-fixes`
:   Also apply fixes that may change typeset output (requires `--fix`)

`--stdin-filepath <PATH>`
:   Name the stdin buffer so its language is dispatched by extension (`.bib` → BibTeX, anything else → LaTeX). No file is read or written; only the extension is used. Ignored when paths are given

`--exclude <PATTERN>`
:   Gitignore-style pattern to skip during directory discovery (repeatable). Added on top of any `exclude`/`extend-exclude` from `badness.toml`

`--force-exclude`
:   Apply exclude patterns to files named explicitly on the command line too (they are normally always processed). For runners like pre-commit that pass staged files as arguments

`--select <RULE>`
:   Run only these rules (repeatable). Overrides `[lint] select` from `badness.toml` when given

`--ignore <RULE>`
:   Disable these rules (repeatable). Overrides `[lint] ignore` from `badness.toml` when given

`--explain <RULE>`
:   Print the description and examples for a rule id, then exit. Ignores paths, config, and fixes

## `badness parse`

Parse LaTeX source and print its concrete syntax tree (CST).

A debugging aid: prints the lossless parse tree as an indented `KIND@range` listing, with token text, followed by any parse errors. With a path, parses that file. With no path, reads stdin.

**Usage:** `badness parse [PATH]`

### Arguments

`<PATH>`
:   File to parse. Omit to read from stdin

## `badness lsp`

Run the language server over stdio

**Usage:** `badness lsp`

## `badness init`

Write a commented starter `badness.toml` to the current directory

**Usage:** `badness init [OPTIONS]`

### Options

`--force`
:   Overwrite an existing `badness.toml`
